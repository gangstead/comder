### You've found a work in progress.
I'm looking for help adding exercises, all pull requests considered.  Some ideas for future exercises:

Pithy name | Description
---------- | -----------
OPTION_ME | Create options with short flags (`-o`) and long names ('--option'), should be easy
FEEL_THE_COERCION | Pull a variable from an option
EXPRESSION_REGULAR | Use regex to make sure option variables fit an expected form
VARIADIC_ARGUMENTS | (Name not pithy enough) The last argument can be variadic
COMDER_COMMANDS | Git-style sub-commands
COMMAND_ACTION | Register a callback function for a command
