### You've found a work in progress.
I'm looking for help adding exercises, all pull requests considered.  Some ideas for future exercises:

Pithy name | Description
---------- | -----------
OPTION_ME | Create options with short flags (`-o`) and long names ('--option'), should be easy
FEEL_THE_COERCION | Pull a variable from an option
EXPRESSION_REGULAR | Use regex to make sure option variables fit an expected form
VARIADIC_ARGUMENTS | (Name not pithy enough) The last argument can be variadic
COMDER_COMMANDS | Git-style sub-commands
COMMAND_ACTION | Register a callback function for a command



![Comder menu](https://raw.github.com/gangstead/comder/master/comder.png)

  1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
  2. Run `npm install comder -g`
  3. Run `comder`


<b><code>comder</code></b> will run through a series of Node.js workshops. Starting at a basic `basic concept palceholder` and moving on to `list of concepts placeholder`.
